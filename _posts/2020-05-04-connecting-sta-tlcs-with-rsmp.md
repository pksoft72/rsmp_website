The Swedish Transport Administration – Trafikverket (STA) has about 527 traffic controllers nationwide. Since 2011 there has been an ongoing task of connecting the traffic controllers using RSMP.

Existing traffic controllers has been upgraded or replaced in order to support RSMP. New and upgraded controllers needs to support RSMP Core specification version 3.1.2 or later and Signal Exchange List (SXL) for traffic controllers version 1.0.7 or later. Both Swarco and Dynniq has implemented RSMP in their controllers.

Currently about 107 traffic controllers are connected using RSMP (as of March 2020), and about 170 controllers are scheduled to be connected in the near future.  The goal is that all traffic controllers will be connected using RSMP by 2025.

In 2011 the STA made a tender for a new central management and monitoring system for the traffic signals based on the RSMP protocol. The system called ÖTS-2 is currently being implemented by Swarco and will provide STA with the options for monitoring and control provided through the RSMP protocol.

This functionality will work across different types of controllers using RSMP. The specifications used for the traffic controllers, will be uniform to any roadside equipment that STA has deployed, meaning an equal asset management across all units in the country.

A key feature within RSMP is the aggregated status message, which is also a  STA standard for monitoring . Using the aggregated status message, monitoring is completely uniform for any type of road side equipment deployed by the STA. The status message can represent 8 different states defined by the status bit.
