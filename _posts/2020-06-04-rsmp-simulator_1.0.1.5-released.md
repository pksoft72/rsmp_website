The RSMP simulator (for Windows) has been updated to version 1.0.1.5

The RSMP Simulator is an interactive simulator which implements the RSMP protocol. The simulator can be used to test most features of the protocol and it is available in two versions, RSMPGS1 for road side equipment and RSMPGS2 for the supervision system. At STA (Swedish Transport Administration) the simulator is used to validate existing RSMP implementations.
