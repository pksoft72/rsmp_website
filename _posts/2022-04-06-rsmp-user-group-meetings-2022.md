The RSMP Nordic group is pleased to announce the successful launch of a new series of online User Group Meetings, covering a range of topics relevant to users of RSMP.

The User Group Meetings are non-technical meetings with an emphasis on RSMP users sharing experiences, needs, and ideas. It is mainly for for road authorities. The RSMP Nordic Secretariat has a faciliting role.

On March 17th, 2022, a User Group Meeting was held, with the topic “Introduction to RSMP”. The 22 participants were mostly comprised of public authority representatives from local, regional, and national levels in Nordic countries. Most were existing users of RSMP, but we were happy to see many interested public authorities, which have not yet adopted RSMP in their traffic signals and roadside equipment.

A very good and concrete proposal, which came out of the User Group meeting, was for RSMP Nordic to develop templates for how require RSMP when procuring equipment and traffic signals. 

The next User Group meeting will be on April 21st, 2022, on the theme “RSMP and Testing Tools”. This User Group meeting will be a bit more technical than others. Though public authorities will still be the main target audience and the information will be relevant for all RSMP users, suppliers and producers will be invited as well to discuss their testing procedures and the new RSMP testing tools described on https://rsmp-nordic.org/tools/.

If you would like to attend, and have not already been invited, please write [Jos van Vlerken](mailto:cz9y@kk.dk).
