## Working Groups
The RSMP Nordic Working Groups discuss technical issues and produce proposals for review by the Board. The working groups are where we shape the next versions of the RSMP specifications.

Anyone interested can [join]({% link pages/activities.md %}) the RSMP working groups, but only RSMP Nordic partners can be listed as co-authors of proposals.

## Core
#### Task
Develop and maintain the core RSMP specification.

#### Timeline
Next scheduled releases is 3.3 planned for autumn 2023.

#### Activity
Online meetings as needed.

## Traffic Light Controllers
#### Task
Develop and maintain the SXL (signal exchange list) for Traffic Light Controllers.

#### Timeline
Next scheduled releases is 1.2 planned for autumn 2023.

#### Activity
Online Meetings as needed.

## Version 4 Exploration
#### Task
Research the opportunities of a core version 4.0, as well the resources and risk that would be involved.

Version 4.0 would be a version with some larger changes that solve some of the limitations of the existing specification. 
Questions to be answered include:

-	Resources required for specification development?
-	Resource required to implement in systems/equipment
-	Opportunities and value, it could provide. Whatâ€™s the use-cases and current needs?
-	Risks involved

The goal will be to answer these questions and provide a recommendation on whether and when to move ahead with Core 4.0 or focus on more conservative releases of the 3.x series.

#### Timeline
There is no release schedule yet for the possible v4 release.

-	End of 2022: Initial draft
-	Start of 2023 invite suppliers to comment on the draft
-	2023: Detailing of draft
-	End of 2023: Decision on whether to move ahead with a v4, or stay on the 3.x series
-	Autumn 2024: Release

The above timeline might change.

#### Activity
Online meetings every second week.

## Variable Messages Signs, Traffic Counters and other types of equipment
#### Task
RSMP can be used for many different types of equipment, and this is indeed already the case in many cities. However, only the SXL for Traffic Light Controllers have been standardized by RSMP Nordic all other uses of RSMP for other types of equipment rely on custom SXLs. This means every project reinvent the same type of messages, and that equipment and systems using these custom SXLs are incompatible.

The task of the working group is to standardize and publish SXLs for other types of equipment. 

The tentative list of equipment types include:

-	Variable Message Signs
-	Traffic Counters
- I/O devices

Work could potentially utilize improvements in Core 4.0 for SXL modules, in case a v4 is implemented, which is the topic of the Version 4 Exploration working group. The two working groups must therefore coordinate.

#### Timeline
Initial timeline: 

- Invite suppliers to working group: 2023
- Tentative release: autumn 2023
- Note that the activity plan had October 2022 as a tentative release schedule, but this is no longer possible.

The timeline might change.

#### Activity
Online meetings once per month.
