# Working Groups
The RSMP Nordic Working Groups discuss specific topics and produce proposals for review by the Board. The working groups are where we shape the next versions of the RSMP specifications.

Most working groups focus on technical issues, like developing the RSMP specification and tools, but workings groups can also handle things like communication, outreach or funding.

The working groups reflect the latest Activity Plan agreed by the Steering Group, and can also be created ad-hoc by the Board as needed.

Meeting summaries can be found at our main RSMP [discussion area](https://github.com/orgs/rsmp-nordic/discussions/categories/working-groups).

Anyone interested can join the RSMP working groups, but only RSMP Nordic partners can be listed as co-authors of proposals. Please contact the [secretariat]({% link pages/contact.md %}) for more info.


## Core
Maintain and develop the core RSMP specification which defines the basic message structure and behavior that is common for all types of equipment.

#### Timeline
Continously, with a yearly release around October.

#### Schedule
Biweekly online meetings.


## Traffic Light Controllers
Maintain and develop the SXL (Signal Exchange List) for Traffic Light Controllers.

#### Timeline
Continously, with a yearly release around October.

#### Schedule
Biweekly online meetings.


## Support for RSMP in LISA and similar systems
Investigate what's required for RSMP support in LISA and similar software packages. This includes dialogue with relevant partners, and cosnidering what new RSMP messages needed in the SXL for Traffic Light Controllers.

The output will be a recommendation to the board and steering group.

#### Timeline
Recommendation to Steering Group by autumn 2024.

#### Schedule
Ad-hoc


## SXL Standardization
Standardize and publish SXLs for other types of equipment.

RSMP can be used for many different types of equipment, and this is indeed already the case in many cities. However, only the SXL for Traffic Light Controllers have been standardized by RSMP Nordic all other uses of RSMP for other types of equipment rely on custom SXLs. This means every project reinvent the same type of messages, and that equipment and systems using these custom SXLs are incompatible.

The initial proposed list of equipment types to support include, Variable Message Signs, Traffic Counters and I/O devices.

#### Timeline
Release in spring 2024 (tentative).

#### Schedule
Biweekly online meetings.


## RSMP 4
Research the opportunities of a core version 4.0, as well the resources and risk that would be involved.

Version 4.0 would include larger changes that solve some of the limitations of the existing specification but might not be backwards compatible.

Questions to be answered include:

-	Opportunities and benefits?
-	Resources required?
-	Risks involved?

The goal is to answer these questions and provide a recommendation on whether and when to move ahead with Core 4.0 or focus on more conservative releases of the 3.x series.

#### Timeline
Decision on v4 at end of 2023, release in 2024 (expected to move).

#### Schedule
Biweekly online meetings.
