## Working Groups
The RSMP Nordic Working Groups discuss technical issues and produce proposals for review by the Board. The working groups are where we shape the next versions of the RSMP specifications.

Anyone interested can [join]({% link pages/activities.md %}) the RSMP working groups, but only RSMP Nordic partners can be listed as co-authors of proposals.
